# IPW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier restricted mean survival times
This project contains an R function for inverse probability weighted (IPW) adjusted restricted mean survival times in observational studies. We also provide a working example using the dataset 'lung' from the {survival} package.

We acknowledge the source code of F. Le Borgne and Y. Foucher, authors of the 'adjusted.KM' function from {IPWsurvival} package, and Hajime Uno, Lu Tian, Angel Cronin, Chakib Battioui, and Miki Horiguchi, authors of the 'rmst1 function' from {survRM2} package.
